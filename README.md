## Computational Representation

> A computational representation is an *executable* [digital representation](#digital-representation) consisting of computational algorithms and supporting data representing some subject matter from a dynamic perspective.

Examples include simulations and predictive analytics.

The subject matter of computational representation is typically a process or a set of entities with properties that are a function of time over the time-frame of interest.

When executed (aka “run”), computational representations often take [stored representations](#stored-representation) as input and their computational algorithms produce [stored representations](#stored-representation) as output.

Computational representations may also use reference data, which is really just another example of a [stored representation](#stored-representation).

Examples of computational representations include Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models, Machine Learning models, and various other kinds of simulations based on mathematical equations, including those describing laws of physics and engineering.

[Computational representations](#computational-representation) are distinguished from [stored representations](#stored-representation), that do not contain algorithms.
